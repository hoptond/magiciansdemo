# magiciansdemo
This is a sample of the source code for my game, Magicians.

Magicians is a role playing game set at a magical academy. The project was written in C# and utilizes the MonoGame framework. This project, started in 2014, was my first big project in C# (or indeed, any programming language!) and is unfinished, so the code you see may vary in quality and style. I am working on making it more presentable, but this may take some time.

The code uploaded here is incomplete, and is for informative/demonstrational purposes only. If you are interested in using all or part of it, please contact me.
